# MultiLabelTextClassification
Multi-label text classification is one of the most common text classification problems. Here ,multi label text classification 
is implemented using two deep learning approaches for multi-label text classification. In the first approach we used a single dense output
layer with multiple neurons where each neuron represented one label. In the second approach, we
created separate dense layers for each label with one neuron. Results show that in our case, a single
output layer with multiple neurons works better than multiple output layers.
